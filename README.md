## Simple Chat Application (Client-Server)

# Overview

This project is an implementation of a simple client-server chat application in Java, developed as part of the 5COSC022W.2 Client-Server Architectures module, Socket Programming. The application demonstrates basic network programming concepts using TCP sockets, allowing a client and server to establish a connection, send messages, and receive responses.

**The repository contains two main classes:**

âš« **SimpleChatServer:** A server that listens for client connections and responds to messages.

âš« **SimpleChatClient:** A client that connects to the server and sends messages.

This project was built using the NetBeans IDE and follows the guidelines in the tutorial.

# Features

ðŸ“Œ Connection-Oriented Communication: Uses TCP sockets for reliable, ordered data delivery.

ðŸ“Œ Socket Programming: Implements ServerSocket for the server and Socket for the client.

ðŸ“Œ Input/Output Streams: Utilizes InputStream and OutputStream for sending and receiving raw byte data.

ðŸ“Œ Exception Handling: Includes try-catch blocks to manage network-related errors.

---

## Prerequisites

ðŸ“Œ Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher.

ðŸ“Œ NetBeans IDE: Version 18 or higher (optional, for development).

ðŸ“Œ Git: For cloning and managing the repository.

# Running the Application

**1. Start the Server**
   
- Open SimpleChatServer.java in NetBeans.

- Run the file (right-click > Run File or press Shift + F6).

- The server will start listening on a specified port (e.g., 12345â€”check the code for the exact port).

**2. Start the Client**
   
- Open SimpleChatClient.java in NetBeans.

- Run the file in a separate instance or terminal.

- The client will connect to the server (ensure the hostname is localhost and the port matches the serverâ€™s).

**3. Test the Chat**

- Type a message in the client console and press Enter.

- The server will receive the message and send a response back to the client.

- Check the console output on both sides to see the communication.
