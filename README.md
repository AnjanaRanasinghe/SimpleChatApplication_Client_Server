## Simple Chat Application (Client-Server)

# Overview

This project is an implementation of a simple client-server chat application in Java, developed as part of the 5COSC022W.2 Client-Server Architectures course, 
Tutorial Week 03: Socket Programming. The application demonstrates basic network programming concepts using TCP sockets, allowing a client and server to establish a connection, send messages, and receive responses.

**The repository contains two main classes:**

⚫ **SimpleChatServer:** A server that listens for client connections and responds to messages.

⚫ **SimpleChatClient:** A client that connects to the server and sends messages.

This project was built using the NetBeans IDE and follows the guidelines from Exercise 2 in the tutorial.
